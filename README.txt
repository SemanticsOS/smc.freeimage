smc.freeimage - Semantics' FreeImage wrapper for Python
=======================================================

smc.freeimage is a Python interface to the FreeImage and LCMS2 libraries.


Features of FreeImage
=====================

FreeImage wraps mature and widely-used libraries like LibJPEG, LibOpenJPEG,
LibPNG, LibRaw, LibTIFF4, OpenEXR and zlib in a consistent, well documented
and powerful API.

http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/

 * Reading of 35 file formats and writing of more than 19 file formats as of
   FreeImage 3.15.3, including JPEG 2000, multiple subformats of TIFF
   with G3/G4 fax compression and JPEG subsampling.

 * pixel depths from 1-32 bpp standard images up to formats like
   RGBAF and 2x64complex.

 * multi page images

 * Metadata (e.g. EXIF, IPTC/NAA, GeoTIFF, XMP) and ICC

 * Color adjustment, conversion and channel processing

 * Image resizing and rotation

 * High Dynamic Range (HDR) image processing and tone mapping

 * RAW camera files

Contrary to PIL it doesn't contain advanced image filters or drawing
functions. FreeImage focuses on file formats


Features of LCMS2
=================

LCMS2 is a color management engine that implements V2 and V4 ICC profiles up
to V4.3. It supports transformation, proofing and introspection of profiles
for a large variety of color formats and targets.

Features of smc.freeimage
=========================

smc.freeimage is developed as part of the closed source Visual Library
framework.

 * mostly written with Cython with some lines of handwritten C Code and some
   Python helpers.

 * fast, it avoids copying large amounts of data and releases the GIL whenever
   possible.

 * 64bit safe, tested on i386/X86 and AMD64/X86_64 systems

 * thread safe

 * wraps a large subset of FreeImage features

 * compatible with Python 2.6 to 3.3.


Performance
===========

smc.freeimage with libjpeg-turbo read JPEGs about three to six times faster
than PIL and writes JPEGs more than five times faster.

JPEG's restart markers are not compatible with libjpeg-turbo's Huffman
decoder optimization and reduce performance a lot. Please read the section
"Restart Makers" on the page http://www.libjpeg-turbo.org/About/Performance
for more information.

Comparison to PIL (Pros and Cons)
=================================

Pros of smc.freeimage
---------------------

 * Faster! JPEG performance is about 3 to 6 times faster than PIL, numpy buffer
   access is more than 100 times faster and consumes less memory due to zero
   copy design.

 * Modern file formats! smc.freeimage supports JPEG 2000, HDR and EXR high
   dynamic range images and raw camera data (RAW).

 * Full baseline TIFF support! Contrary to PIL smc.freeimage supports all
   flavors of baseline TIFF like G3 and G4 compression and multipage TIFFs.

 * PEP 3118 buffer interface that exports images as 2d or 3d non-contiguous
   buffer.

 * Correct and optimized integration of a color management system (LittleCMS2)
   instead of lcms1 integration including caching of optimized
   transformations, in-place transformation and introspection of profiles.

 * Structured metadata access to EXIF, XMP and IPTC information, also supports
   fast loading of metadata without loading pixel data.

 * Lot's of color types! Bitmap (8bit) with 1, 4, 8, 16, 24 and 32 bits per
   pixel, (unsigned) int 16 and 32, float, double gray scale, complex, RGBA
   16bit and RGBA floats.

 * Static build support, no need for "make install". You just need a C99
   compatible C/C++ compiler, make and nasm (for FreeImage-Turob).


Cons of smc.freeimage
----------------------

 * Few image filters, no support for complex image filters in FreeImage

 * Low quality resize filters are slower than PIL's filters

 * No drawing API for primitives (lines, circles, boxes)

 * No text drawing support and libfreetype integration.

 * Still not feature complete and under development.
